Title: Quake Tracker

Problem

In regions prone to earthquakes, residents often face significant risks due to a lack of immediate information when an earthquake strikes. Traditional warming systems may be slow or ineffective, leaving people with little time to react or take safety measures. In addition, many individuals are unaware of seismic activity until after it has occurred, which can lead to confusion, panic, and delayed responses. This lack of real-time alerts and tracking tools can increase the potential for injury, damage, and loss of life

Solution

Our web app provides a timely, automated response by tracking and recording earthquakes as they happen, offering real-time notifications to civilians. This system allows people to receive critical updates immediately, helping them take quick action, whether it's evacuating, seeking shelter, or avoiding hazardous areas. By bridging the gap between seismic events and public awareness, the app enhances community safety and improves response times during an earthquake emergency
